# Space Shooter 2
This game is a predecesor to [Asteroids ++](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2407300/Asteroids/), and was made before [The Colorful Creature.](https://github.com/Infiland/TheColorfulCreature)
It is very buggy, very bad code, so I decided to open source it, I will just maintain code to work on the recent engine.
